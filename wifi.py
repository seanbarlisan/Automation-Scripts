# Password Manager Roadmap
# ===============================

# 1. Project Scope:
#    - Securely store and manage user passwords.
#    - Protect passwords with encryption.
#    - Use a master password for authentication.
#    - Provide CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
#    - Include a password generator for strong passwords.
#    - Optional: Build a user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI).

# 2. Project Structure:
#    - main.py            # Entry point of the application.
#    - encryption.py      # Handles encryption and decryption logic.
#    - database.py        # Manages password storage (file or database).
#    - utils.py           # Password generator and helper functions.
#    - requirements.txt   # Dependencies list for the project.

# 3. Core Features:
#    A. Master Password System:
#       - Prompt the user to set or verify the master password.
#       - Hash or encrypt the master password for secure storage.
#       - Verify the master password before allowing access.

#    B. Password Storage:
#       - Use a secure storage method:
#         - Option 1: SQLite database with fields for service, username, and password.
#         - Option 2: JSON or CSV file with encrypted passwords.
#       - Ensure passwords are stored in encrypted form.

#    C. Encryption and Decryption:
#       - Encrypt passwords before saving them to storage.
#       - Decrypt passwords only when retrieving or displaying them.
#       - Use a strong encryption library for security.

#    D. Password Generator:
#       - Generate strong, random passwords.
#       - Allow customization (length, symbols, numbers, upper/lowercase).

#    E. CRUD Operations:
#       - Create: Add new passwords for a service.
#       - Read: Retrieve and display stored passwords (decrypt when needed).
#       - Update: Modify existing stored passwords.
#       - Delete: Remove passwords from storage.

# 4. User Interface:
#    - Option 1: CLI (Command-Line Interface):
#       - Create a menu with options:
#         1. Add a password.
#         2. View passwords.
#         3. Update a password.
#         4. Delete a password.
#         5. Generate a new password.
#         6. Exit the program.
#       - Gather inputs from the user for each operation.

#    - Option 2: GUI (Optional):
#       - Use 'tkinter' or 'PyQt' to design a graphical interface.
#       - Include buttons, input fields, and dialogs for easy interaction.
#       - Features include viewing, adding, updating, and deleting passwords.

# 5. Security Considerations:
#    - Master Password:
#       - Hash and verify the master password securely.
#    - Encryption:
#       - Always encrypt passwords before saving them.
#       - Ensure the encryption key is secure and derived properly.
#    - Error Handling:
#       - Handle invalid inputs, permission issues, or missing files/databases.
#    - Sensitive Data:
#       - Avoid showing plaintext passwords unless explicitly requested.
#       - Clear decrypted data from memory after use.

# 6. Testing:
#    - Functional Testing:
#       - Verify that all features (CRUD, encryption, generator) work as intended.
#    - Edge Cases:
#       - Test behavior with an incorrect or missing master password.
#       - Handle empty storage files or databases gracefully.
#    - Security Testing:
#       - Ensure passwords are not stored or displayed in plaintext.
#       - Validate encryption and decryption processes.

# 7. Deployment:
#    - Package the application as an executable using 'pyinstaller'.
#    - Test the packaged version on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
#    - Include a README.md file with installation and usage instructions.
#    - Optional: Share the project on GitHub for collaboration or portfolio purposes.

# 8. Future Enhancements:
#    - Add auto-lock functionality after inactivity.
#    - Implement password strength validation.
#    - Provide backup and restore options for encrypted data.
#    - Add search functionality for quick password retrieval.
#    - Sync passwords securely with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
#    - Support multi-user accounts with unique master passwords.

# ===============================
# Innovative Features to Stand Out
# ===============================

# 18. Password Vault with Built-in Security Breach Alerts:
#    - Integrate an API (like "Have I Been Pwned") to monitor if any stored passwords are compromised.
#    - Send notifications to the user when their saved passwords have been exposed in data breaches.
#    - Why Unique: Combining breach monitoring with password vaults is not widespread.

# 19. AI-Driven Risk Scoring for Stored Passwords:
#    - Implement AI-based analysis to evaluate the security of stored passwords and suggest improvements.
#    - Provide risk scores and advice on changing weak or reused passwords.
#    - Why Unique: Moves beyond static strength checks, offering personalized security suggestions.

# 20. Privacy-Focused Feature: Password Management Without Cloud Integration:
#    - Offer offline-only password management, where all data is stored locally with encrypted backups.
#    - Ensure maximum privacy by eliminating cloud-related risks.
#    - Why Unique: Fully offline password managers prioritize user privacy more than cloud-based alternatives.
